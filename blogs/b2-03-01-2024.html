    <p>In the digital world, most of its security built upon modularity. Think of the analogue wall clock as a modular numbering system. A similar system plays as the heart of cryptography. From mobile login passcodes to military secrets, modularity is the essence.</p>
    <h2>Why Modularity Matters</h2>
    <p>Think of it as a set of numbers in a finite group, where we apply sum and product operations to these numbers within the group. These properties are similar to the number reset on the clock.</p>

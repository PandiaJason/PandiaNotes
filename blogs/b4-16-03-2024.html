    <p>Programmers are continuous discrete thinkers. They bring their imagination into programs. Don't just learn the language; learn to program.</p>
    <h2>Logic: Discrete Discipline</h2>
    <p>Discipline is the way to handle things in a more procedural manner in the random and uncertain lifestyle; this can be called protocols. Discipline is the key for a programmer to start actual programming. It doesn't come from fancy courses or boot camps until a person starts with disciplined imagination.</p>
    <h2>Handling: Continuous Thinking</h2>
    <p>A computer is a discrete calculator, but true continuous logic comes from the imagination. For example, handling loops and statements, variables. Again, don't learn the language; learn to program.</p>
    <h2>Solve: Discrete Continuous Steps</h2>
    <p>The Flowcharts, Algorithms, UML diagrams, block diagrams, Class diagrams are some of the names for visualizing what's going to be in the discrete continuous solution. In actuality, these are continuous discrete steps, which are going to happen one by one or simultaneously.</p>
    <p>Now, apply these three points in any programming language you're familiar with, because language is not a barrier! Thanks for reading.</p>

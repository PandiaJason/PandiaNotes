    </header>
    <p>A Computer is a General Purpose Calculator(computational system), Just like your mid-school scientific electronic calculator that speeds up calculations.</p>
    <h2>Power of Manupulation aka Programming?</h2>
    <p>Logicians manipulate electrons to function for desired calculations - this method is called programming. There are efficient ways to manupulate the computing calculators(will be covering in upcoming topics). For now, get the point that all computers are limited machines. That can only perform manipulated tasks(includes Generative AI).</p>
    <h2>Limitation Game: Art of Abstraction</h2>
    <p>Let's stick with a 3d game: GTA Vice City. We can notice that the map is limited compared to game Minecraft. That's art of abstraction. Games like Vice City has similarities to the real world, but the Minecraft style is very different. In both cases, we are running programs in a limited environment. With the help of mathematics, we can make simulations like Minecraft. Still these programs running on limitational system. Most of today's game  world animation are feels real. Still, Logicians developed efficient manipulation mechanisms on top of limitations.</p>
    <p>Question: How small single cell organisms are? That's very small with infinate details. I say we can't even generate/create an actual single-cell organism inside a computer. Science says we are all made up of atoms, we do have electrons. But it's impossible to program a successful single-cell organism. We can't do any real life inside a computer. Even at an atomic level.</p>
    <p>We abstract everything in the computer. Logicians can do better limitation game and manipulation rules. </p>

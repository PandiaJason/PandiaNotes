        <h1><em>Why Choose C?</em></h1>
    </header>
    <p>There is a misconception about who is  a programmer and who is a developer, and similarly, there is a misunderstanding between Programming Languages and Scripting Languages. In the SaaS sector, Java, JS, and Python are often considered high-tier languages. So, why choose C?</p>
    <h2>C is not a Caveat, but a Creation</h2>
    <p>Presently, I'm a Master's in CS Engineering, preparing for a PhD in Space Network Communications. In my bachelor days, I had a wrong belief, thinking C is a caveat. I skipped the taste of C. I was introduced to Python and its indentations. I can't even understand what's going on in the code, even for simple loops. I can't get the meaning of it, but I upscaled with the Python syntax more than the logics. While completing my Master's program, I ditched all other languages like JS (which I was using for my web3 startup) and got into Go, then switched into K and R C. I haven't completed the K and R but got its essence. How beautiful a programming language can be. How thoughtful for a programmer to visualize the code of others. Its very simple syntax, and with great power (*ptr), comes great responsibility (&response).</p>
    <h2>By the Machine for The Machine</h2>
    <p>You all know the industry is changing, with the advent of Gen AI. Thanks to C++, which is also Complex++ or C with Complexity. No more C++ jokes; it is way better than Java and other scripting languages. The complexity of C++ even pays off to build efficient large systems. When an ML person talks about PyTorch, I think of C++Torch, lol. C/C++ is the most elegant, and mostly it should be called programming languages.</p>
    <h2>Prepare for Segmentation Faults</h2>
    <p>Yeah, Python, JavaScript, and their frameworks are very cool, but most of the time, we are developing some software (UI one) than actually programming. It can make machines replace us. Today, we can't code without an AI assistant, similar to Stack Overflow and official documentation. AI Coder is a boost and can also replace us. So, if you are thinking about Segmentation Faults, our seg faults are job loss. Develop a Creative/Complex++ profile for your future.</p>
    <p>Now, I'm realizing the power of C/C++ programming. It is making me a more Creative/Complex++ programmer.</p>
    <strong>NOTE: I use ++C, not C++.</strong>
